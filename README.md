# PCD_Community_Clouds
Processing Community Day 
Community Clouds made in p5js

I attended Processing Community Day in October 2017 (https://day.processing.org/). 
Dan Shiffman gave a Coding Train talk and demonstrating making a cloud generating function. Some attendees worked along with him in real time. Dan asked for new cloud generating schemes to be submitted here:

My version is in this repository. It places circles around the perimeter of a larger ellipse. Circle radius varies by position on the ellipse. Then it draws the ellipse over top of the circles, essentially "erasing" the inner halve of them. It's a bit ham-fisted right now and I'd like to make it smoother. TBD.
