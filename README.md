# PCD_Community_Clouds
Processing Community Day 
Community Clouds made in p5js

I attended Processing Community Day in October 2017 (https://day.processing.org/). 
Dan Shiffman gave a Coding Train talk and demonstrating making a cloud generating function. Some attendees worked along with him in real time. Dan asked for new cloud generating schemes to be submitted here:

I made one, the code for which is in the repository.
